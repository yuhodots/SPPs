# Signal Propagation Plots

## Features

### 1. Signal Propagation Plots

TBU

### 2. Signal Propagation Videos

TBU

### 3. NF-ResNets w/ PyTorch

There are ResNets and NF-ResNets files in the `models` directory.

I added Beta update codes in [vballoli's codes](https://github.com/vballoli/nfnets-pytorch) for a more accurate reproduction of the original paper. 


## How to Use?
